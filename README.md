# Formula Sed

This repo contains the official implementation of our paper:

> **"Formula-Supervised Sound Event Detection: Pre-Training Without Real Data"**  
> *(ICASSP2025)*

The aim is to facilitate research and development by offering synthetic data that can be used in various audio-related machine learning workflows.

## Current Status

- [x] **Artificial Acoustic Data Generation**: The code for generating the proposed artificial acoustic data for pre-training is publicly available.
- [] **Pre-training Code**: The code for pre-training will be released in the future.


## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YutoShibata07/formula_sed.git
cd formula_sed
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Stay tuned for updates regarding the release of the pre-training code. We appreciate your interest in this project!
